# What is Mate?

Yerba Mate is a traditional drink that has its roots in South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. It is a natural stimulant that is extracted from the leaves of the mate tree (Ilex paraguariensis). This tree produces nutrient-rich leaves that are collected, dried and then can be prepared in a variety of ways - traditionally prepared as a hot drink in calabashes, which are often decorated with hand-carved designs.

Yerba Mate is popular for its positive effects on the body and mind. It contains many beneficial nutrients, including vitamins (A, C, E, B-complex), minerals (calcium, iron, potassium) and antioxidants.
